# Legacy GUI Trial Builders Package

**Note**: This package contains legacy trial builders for the GUI system.

For new development, use the canonical builders in `+builders/+oddball/` which provide:
- Full schema-driven validation
- Constraint satisfaction
- Proper parameter handling
- Integration with MaestroContext

This package is maintained for backward compatibility with `launch_gui.m`.
