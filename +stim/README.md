# Legacy GUI Stimulus Package

**Note**: This package contains legacy stimulus generators for the GUI system.

For new development, use the canonical generators in `+generators/+audio/+tone/` which provide:
- Full schema-driven validation
- Proper ramp application
- Calibration support
- Integration with MaestroContext

This package is maintained for backward compatibility with `launch_gui.m`.
