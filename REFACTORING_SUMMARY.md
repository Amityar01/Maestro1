## Phase 1: Unified Discovery System ✅

### Problem
- 3 nearly identical discovery functions (`discover_generators`, `discover_builders`, `discover_engines`)
- Duplicate `find_schema_files()` helper function (3x)
- 353 total lines of duplicated code
- Difficult to maintain consistency across plugin types

### Solution
**Created**: `+core/+discovery/PluginDiscovery.m` (231 lines)

- Single, unified discovery mechanism for all plugin types
- Extracted common validation logic
- Parameterized differences (schema filenames, types, field names)
- **Deleted**: 3 duplicate files

### Benefits
- 35% reduction in discovery code
- Single source of truth for plugin discovery
- Easier to add new plugin types
- Consistent error handling across all discovery paths

---

## Phase 2: Package Structure Clarification ✅

### Problem
- Duplicate packages: `+stim` vs `+generators/+audio/+tone`
- Conflicting locations: `+trials/+builders` vs `+builders`
- Unclear which version is canonical
- Risk of using wrong implementation

### Solution
- Documented legacy packages with README.md files
- Clarified that `+generators`, `+builders`, `+engines` are canonical
- Marked `+stim` and `+trials` as legacy GUI components
- Preserved backward compatibility with existing GUI code

### Benefits
- Clear package hierarchy
- Reduced developer confusion
- Documented migration path
- No breaking changes to GUI

---

## Phase 3: Configuration & Normalization Extraction ✅

### Problem
- `RunnerCore` had 481 lines handling too many responsibilities:
  - Configuration loading/merging
  - Instance normalization
  - Validation
  - Execution orchestration
  - File I/O
  - State management
- Violated Single Responsibility Principle
- Difficult to test individual concerns

### Solution
**Created**:
1. `+core/+config/ConfigurationManager.m` (235 lines)
   - `load_json_file()`, `save_json_file()`
   - `merge_structs()`, `coerce_scalar_struct()`
   - `get_field_or_default()`, `validate_required_field()`
   - `normalize_engine_config()`
   - `create_session_metadata()`

2. `+core/+normalization/InstanceNormalizer.m` (275 lines)
   - `normalize_block_instance()`
   - `ensure_block_instance()`
   - `load_block_instance_from_file()`
   - `normalize_blocks_from_artifact()`

### Benefits
- Clear separation of concerns
- Each class has single, well-defined purpose
- Individually testable components
- Reusable across codebase
- `RunnerCore` simplified significantly

---

## Phase 4: Engine Architecture Improvement ✅

### Problem
- `+engines/+audio_only/execute.m` was 369 lines doing everything:
  - DAQ initialization
  - Trial execution
  - Stimulus generation
  - Signal mixing
  - TTL generation
  - Logging
- Monolithic, difficult to test
- No separation between hardware and logic

### Solution
**Created**:
1. `+engines/+audio_only/DAQManager.m` (234 lines)
   - Encapsulates all DAQ hardware operations
   - Clean initialization/cleanup lifecycle
   - Configurable from Constants
   - Proper resource management (destructor)
   - Methods: `initialize()`, `play_trial()`, `play_trial_async()`, `wait()`, `generate_ttl_pulse()`, `cleanup()`

2. `+engines/+audio_only/TrialExecutor.m` (176 lines)
   - Handles trial execution logic
   - Stimulus generation
   - Signal mixing
   - Log data creation
   - No hardware dependencies (uses DAQManager)

**Refactored**: `execute.m` reduced from 369 → 182 lines (-51%)

### Benefits
- Clean separation: hardware (DAQ) vs logic (execution)
- DAQManager is independently testable (mock hardware)
- TrialExecutor can be unit tested
- execute.m now just orchestration
- Easier to add new hardware backends

---

## Phase 5: Constants Management ✅

### Problem
- Magic numbers scattered throughout codebase:
  - Default sampling rate: 192000 (in 3+ places)
  - Calibration reference: 100 dB (in 2 places)
  - Default ramp: 5 ms (hardcoded)
  - TTL voltage: 5.0 V (hardcoded)
  - File naming patterns, directory names, etc.
- Inconsistencies between files
- Difficult to change system-wide defaults

### Solution
**Created**: `+core/Constants.m` (246 lines)

Centralized constants in logical categories:
- **Audio System**: sampling rates, calibration, ramp durations
- **DAQ/Hardware**: vendor, device IDs, channel names, TTL settings
- **Timing**: ITI defaults and limits
- **Experiment Defaults**: engine type, logging level, session defaults
- **Validation**: schema versions, filenames
- **Directory Structure**: all directory names
- **File Naming**: metadata, logs, results
- **Datetime Formats**: all format strings
- **Numeric Limits**: frequency, duration, trial count ranges
- **Status Codes**: all state and log level strings

**Plus validation helpers**:
- `validate_sampling_rate()`
- `validate_frequency()`
- `validate_duration()`

### Benefits
- Single source of truth for all system constants
- Easy to change system-wide defaults
- Self-documenting (organized by category)
- Compile-time constant checking
- Validation helpers prevent invalid values

---

## Phase 6: Validation Infrastructure ✅

### Problem
- Validation logic duplicated across many files
- Inconsistent error messages
- No reusable validation functions
- Repeated field checking, range validation, enum validation

### Solution
**Created**: `+core/+validation/ValidationHelpers.m` (237 lines)

Reusable validation functions:
- `validate_required_fields()` - check multiple required fields
- `validate_numeric_range()` - range check with optional integer constraint
- `validate_probability()` - specialized for [0, 1] range
- `validate_enum()` - check value in allowed set
- `validate_struct()`, `validate_cell_array()` - type checking
- `validate_experiment_spec()` - full experiment validation
- `validate_block_instance()` - block instance validation
- `validate_stimulus_spec()` - stimulus spec validation
- `safe_validate()` - wrapper for error catching

### Benefits
- DRY principle for validation
- Consistent, clear error messages
- Easier to add new validation rules
- Reusable across entire codebase
- Better error reporting

## Design Patterns Applied

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each class has one clear purpose
   - ConfigurationManager: config only
   - DAQManager: hardware only
   - TrialExecutor: logic only

2. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**
   - Eliminated 3 duplicate discovery functions
   - Centralized all constants
   - Reusable validation functions

3. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Hardware separated from logic
   - Configuration separated from execution
   - Validation separated from business logic

4. **Dependency Injection**
   - DAQManager injected into TrialExecutor
   - MaestroContext injected into executors
   - Enables testing with mocks

5. **Factory Pattern**
   - PluginDiscovery creates plugin instances
   - ConfigurationManager creates metadata structs

6. **Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)**
   - DAQManager has proper destructor
   - Ensures cleanup even on error

---

## Testing Improvements

### Before Refactoring
- Monolithic functions difficult to test
- Couldn't test DAQ logic without hardware
- Couldn't test configuration without full system
- Limited mocking capabilities

### After Refactoring
- Each class independently testable
- DAQManager can be mocked for TrialExecutor tests
- ConfigurationManager pure functions (no side effects)
- ValidationHelpers easy to unit test
- Constants enable consistent test fixtures

---

## Backward Compatibility

**Zero breaking changes** to public API:
- ✅ `MaestroContext` constructor unchanged
- ✅ `execute()` function signature unchanged
- ✅ All plugin interfaces unchanged
- ✅ Legacy GUI packages preserved
- ✅ Existing experiments run without modification
